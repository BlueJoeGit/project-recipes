    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While not 'authentic,' these crispy crab and cream cheese wontons are one of the most addictive, delicious, and crowd-pleasing appetizers ever created. 
       That is, if the filling has enough crab in it. 
       I'm using a 1 to 1 ratio of crab to cream cheese.
    </p>

    <h2>Chef´s Note</h2>
    <p>You can fold these into triangles which is easier, but I prefer the "warhead" fold because you get more crispy goodness with the four crunchy edges.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces crab meat, drained well</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>1 clove crushed garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>60 wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>Canola oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sriracha hot sauce, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix cream cheese, crab meat, green onions, garlic, soy sauce, fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, sesame oil, and cayenne pepper together with a fork until ingredients are blended thoroughly. 
            Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, 1 or 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Keep wonton wrappers moist by covering with a damp paper towel.
            Place a small bowl of water nearby on the work surface. 
            With a wet fingertip, moisten surface of wonton. 
            Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of crab filling in center of wonton. 
            Fold 2 opposite corners toward each other over the filling but without touching tips together yet. 
            Fold up the other 2 corners. 
            Working gently from the bottom, squeeze out any air bubbles; pinch together the 4 seams from the bottom up to create a modified pyramid (or "warhead") shape.
            Place on a dry surface. 
            Continue with remaining wontons.</li>
        <li>Drain eggs and fill the pan with very cold water.
            Let eggs sit in cold water until they are cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in deep fryer to 350 degrees F. 
            Fry wontons in batches until golden brown and crispy, gently moving them around in the oil with a strainer to brown each surface, about 3 minutes. 
            Let cool about a minute before eating. 
            Serve with the dipping sauce.</li>
        <li>Whisk ketchup, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and sriracha sauce together in a bowl for the dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
